Like most others, Wubbzy was my childhood, and I really enjoyed watching him and his friends get into silly shenanigans. Another reason I like Wubbzy is because of the songs that were featured after an episode. I'm glad that Wubbzy is still relevant on this site and he still manages to make me laugh and smile. So Happy Anniversary, Wubbzy.ðŸ˜€
